Rei de Salém Alimentos is a company that sells 100% natural food mostly without gluten.

The client needed a new <code>e-commerce website</code> to sell their products directly to their consumers. It was designed by café-do digital agency and coded by myself using WordPress with WooCommerce and integrated to PagSeguro and MercadoPago payment gateways and Correios post service.

**Update:** The company no longer sell its products online. The website now show info about their products.
