Rei de Salém Alimentos is a company that sells 100% natural food mostly without gluten.

The client needed a new e-commerce website to sell their products directly to their consumers. It was designed by café-do digital agency and coded by myself using WordPress with WooCommerce and integrated to PagSeguro and MercadoPago payment gateways and Correios post service.
