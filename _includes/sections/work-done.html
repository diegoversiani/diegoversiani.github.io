      Joseph Santos is a professional photographer from Belo Horizonte/Brazil. He needed a portfolio website and blog to talk about what it means to be a photographer.

    <p>
      We <u>designed his logo</u>, <u>business card</u> and <u>website</u> to be <em>clean, beaultiful</em> and prioritise his photo shoots while representing his personality. My biggest contributions was <u>main design</u> decisions, <u>coding</u> and server configuration.
