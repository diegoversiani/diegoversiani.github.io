        <h3>I'm Diego Versiani,</h3>
        <p>a web developer and user experience designer with a penchant for business management and gamification. I currently work as a Freelancer and have 10+ years experience in the field.</p>
        <p>I love to create stuff, it can be websites, houses, the interior of my motorhome (Matilda) or delicious meals. I like traveling, hiking and hitchhiking, to take care of Matilda's health, baking and fermenting food in jars.</p>
        <p>I care about our Mother Earth and try as much as I can to live in harmony with nature.</p>
