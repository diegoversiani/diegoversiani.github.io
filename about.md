### Hi, I'm Diego Versiani


A Passionate **WordPress Developer** with over 10 years experience.

I love to create stuff, it can be websites, houses, the interior of my motorhome (Matilda) or delicious meals. I like traveling, hiking and hitchhiking, to take care of Matilda's health, baking and fermenting food in jars.

I'm passionate about sustainability and alternative energy solutions. I follow an _almost_ vegan diet and a minimalist lifestyle.


### What will you find here?

I post about code, my [side projects]({{ site.url }}#side-projects) and other things I love.


### Hire Me, or just say hi!

I'm available to work on a project or per hour basis.

And I'm always looking for a coding buddy, so get in touch!
