### Hi, I'm Diego Versiani

I make **Fast WordPress Websites** for any screen size.

Since over 10 years I do what I love while helping [my clients]({{ site.baseurl }}work) give their clients a better web experience.

**About myself**: I love to make things, it can be websites, houses, the interior of my motorhome (Matilda) or delicious meals. I like traveling, hiking, baking and fermenting food in jars.

I'm passionate about sustainability and alternative energy solutions. I follow an _almost_ vegan diet and a minimalist lifestyle.

### Side Projects

I have started some open source [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}projects).

### Hire Me!

I'm available to work on a project or per hour basis.
