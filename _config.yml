description: >
  My name is Diego Versiani, I’m a web developer with a penchant for business management and gamification. 
  I’m currently working as a Freelancer WordPress Developer.
  I love to create stuff, it can be websites, houses, the interior of my motorhome (Matilda) or delicious meals.
  I like traveling, taking care of Matilda's health, baking and fermenting food in jars.
