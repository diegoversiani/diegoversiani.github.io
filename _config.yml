  I currently work as a Freelancer. More specifically, I work for 
  <a href="http://cafe-do.com" target="_blank">café-do digital agency</a> coding websites in 
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>

  <br><br>
  I like things on their own place and I love to build stuff, it can be websites, houses, the interior of 
  our van (Matilda) or just a new tool for whatever I need to do.
  <br><br>  
  I like traveling and taking care of Matilda's health, baking and fermenting 
  food in jars. I love food, the kind that nourishes my body and soul!
